- Create an array of available characters that a user could enter: COMPLETED
- Add headers with the appropriate text for the DOM
- Make Wins, Losses, Guesses Left, Your Guesses so far variables with an incremental value of 0 to start
- give JavaScript a function to execute when a user enters a character

- decrement the Guesses Left by 1 for every letter that is selected but is not included in the name of the var alphabetName array
- when the user selects the right letter, print the letter on the screen
- move through the length of the letters in the array
