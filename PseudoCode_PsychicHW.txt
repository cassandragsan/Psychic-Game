Pseudo Code:

Create variables for Wins, Losses, Your Guesses so far, and Guesses left
These should be updateable so that:
1) when a person enters the right letter, it increases the wins by 1
2) when the person enters a letter, it is recorded at the header "Your Guesses So Far"
3) if a person does not pick the proper letter in 10 guesses, the Losses header is increased by 1 and Guesses
left is decreased by 1

if var guesses = var answer then increase wins by 1
onkeyup print the letter in the your guesses so far header
if var guesses <> var answer and guesses left = 0 then losses increased by 1
